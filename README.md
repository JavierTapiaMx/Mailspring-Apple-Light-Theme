# Mailspring Apple Light Theme – Teal & Orange Edition

This theme is based on the excellent [Mailspring-Apple-Theme](https://github.com/mikebiker/Mailspring-Apple-Theme) by [mikebiker](https://github.com/mikebiker).  
I have customized it to introduce a fresh **Teal & Orange** color palette, giving your inbox a modern and vibrant look while preserving the clean Apple-inspired design.

## Features

- Based on the original Apple Light Theme for Mailspring
- Teal & Orange accent colors throughout the interface
- Clean, minimal, and easy on the eyes
- Fully compatible with the latest Mailspring versions

## Installation

1. **Download or Clone this Repository**
   git clone https://github.com/JavierTapiaMx/Mailspring-Apple-Light-Theme.git

2. **Install the Theme in Mailspring**

   - Open Mailspring.
   - Go to `Mailspring > Install New Theme...`
   - Select the directory where you downloaded or cloned this theme.

3. **Activate the Theme**
   - Go to `Mailspring > Change Theme...` and select "Apple Light Theme – Teal & Orange Edition".

## Customization

You can further tweak the theme by editing the LESS files in the `styles` directory.  
Key files include:

- `ui-variables.less` – Main color and UI variable overrides
- `apple-message-list.less` – Message list and thread styling

To reload your changes, open the developer console in Mailspring (`Developer > Toggle Developer Tools`) and run:

```
AppEnv.themes.setActiveTheme('your-theme-name');
```
